Tiny programming language written in Rust.

## Description

This is a passion project im making for practice and fun, while I have time between classes/work.

Example: 
'''
fun fib(n){
    if n <= 1{
        return n;
    }else{
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
    }
}

let n = 9;

let an = fib(n);

println(an);
'''
